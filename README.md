# Nightbug
Nightbug is a Lisp-like programming language. Please note that
Nightbug is in a prototype state and is under development, so the code may be
suboptimal or incomplete at this time. Please ~~watch warmly until it is
ready~~ bear with me!

## Potential questions
* The code quality is awful!
    * Nightbug is in a prototypical state right now. Please see above.
* Why Lisp?
    * Because it happened to be on my mind, and it's apparently easy to parse.
* What's the point of this project?
    * It's just a fun little project. I doubt it'll go anywhere anytime soon, but
      who knows?
* What are your future plans?
    * See [here](https://github.com/Sparkpin/nightbug/projects/2).
